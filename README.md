Flexbox Workout Instruction

- Goals: To master CSS Flexbox, period.
  In order to attain this goal, you will write CSS to accompany the index.html file provided so that the page will look just like the screenshots I have provided in the starter files folder.

- Conditions:
  Do not touch the HTML file. Leave it as is.
  You can create a css stylesheet, of course.
  You are NOT allowed to use CSS Grid. This is a flexbox exercise intended to make you a wizard of flexbox properties. 
  The only display property you can use is flex except for a small number of block or inline-block for text elements if ever needed.
  You can use a little bit of CSS position, but only for the extra large screen.

- Get Started: 
  You can clone this template repository to start the lab exercise.
  https://classroom.github.com/a/MJDyg4Df
  On terminal, run:
  > git clone https://classroom.github.com/a/MJDyg4Df

  This option is recommended for all developers, although there will be no deduction for choosing the second option.
  The intention is to give you more exposure to Git and GitHub.

  In the starter files, I've included an HTML file as well as screenshots of what the site should look like when it's done in 1)extra-small, 2)small, 3)medium, 4)large and 5)extra-large browser width. 
  Extra-small, small and medium screenshots have two parts showing the top and the bottom of the page supposing you can easily guess how the middle part looks like.
  Open the folder on VS Code or an IDE of your choice including Cloud9.

- Tips:
  Media Query breakpoints: Use 600px, 900px, 1200px, and 1700px
  Study the screenshot in detail. Check how menu and main sections change with the browser width. Don’t miss things such as space around the text and image.


- Hand In:
There are two ways to hand in this lab exercise.
1.
Push your work to your own public repository. Note: Do not include screenshots folder.
Write the link to the repo on a text file and submit it to Brightspace. If you could also write the link to the comment section of the assignment submission, that’s appreciated. It’s easier for us to click that link. You still need to submit the text file, though, as Brightspace requires a file to accept a submission.

2.
Rename your working folder containing index.html, styles.css and image file folder to 4835-a3-firstname-lastname. Make sure the work you're submitting does not contain any unnecessary files, such as the screenshots from the starter files. Create a Zip archive from the 4835-a2-firstname-lastname folder and hand it in to Brightspace.
